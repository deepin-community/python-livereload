Description: automatic browser refresher (documentation)
 It is really boring for Web developers to need to refresh their browser
 every time they save a (CSS, JavaScript, or HTML) file. LiveReload will
 take care of that for you, so that when you save a file, your browser
 will refresh itself - and what's more, it can perform tasks such as
 compiling LESS to CSS before the browser reload.
 .
 This package contains API documentation and examples.
